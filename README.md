# FTS-Snipe

Trying to create a bot that snipes liquidity as soon as it gets minted to a contract where my funds got stuck because an explot that tempered the price oracle, allowing the attaker to borrow every asset on the lending platform. 

There is already a bot withdrawing all the liquidity that gets injected, I hope I can beat that or at least be second and recover later

I'm no dev with experience, just a curious guy on a nice and challenging journey
